# go-which

Go-Which is a simplified reimplementation of the Unix 'which' command built in Go. This project is designed to be a practical, beginner-friendly introduction to Go programming, showcasing fundamental concepts such as handling command-line arguments, reading environment variables, and working with file paths.

## Tutorial
This project was created as part of a tutorial for beginners to learn Go (Golang). It covers the basics of Go's syntax and features by building a CLI tool that mimics the Unix 'which' command. This command is used to locate the path of executable binaries in the system. 

For a detailed guide and explanation of how this project was built, check out the full tutorial on my website: [Go-Which Tutorial](https://aubiss.com/posts/recreating-which-command-in-go/)

## Getting Started

To get started with Go-Which, you need to have Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
